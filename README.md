# Why the new repository?
My initial proof-of-concept, a little API endpoint wrapped in a Next.JS build, got a lot more traction than I initially expected so soon. This motivated me to get this project started right, and right now. I will leave that be in a working state rather than refactor, and archive once this project is ready.

Long term plan: Build the JSON in -> PDF out API around a single well-tested resume template of my design. Then seperate the templates into a library, and join this express app and a web front-end (yeah, probably Next) in a monorepo. This may take some time.

# JSON Resume Schema
The resume schema is still being finalized to balance ease-of-use and flexibility.
